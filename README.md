# Mean, Median, Mode

This is a simple exercise I did to practice a little rust in my spare time.
It is the third rust program I have written, and the quality reflects that

## What does it do?

It prompts the user to enter in integers. When the user is done providing
values, the program calculates the mean, median, and mode of all the supplied
data.

## Hey this thing is wrong

Yeah I know. It is not fully accurate as I have not wrapped my mind around 
the rust type system fully.
